# 1JC3-Assign1

* Writing your Assignment
	- Write your assignment code in src/Assign_1.hs
	- Make sure to replace the string `macid` with your actual MacID
	- Replace all error messages with actual implementations of functions
	- Add test cases for your code at the bottom of Assign_1.hs (NOT IN THE test DIRECTORY, we'll use this later)
	- Write your extra credit code in src/Assign_1_ExtraCredit.hs
	- NOTE: Assign_1_ExtaCredit.hs has been left largely blank, you must add the type signatures for all your functions yourself
	- Upon completion, submit ONLY THE Assign_1.hs, Assign_1_ExtraCredit.hs files to avenue
